- 👋 Hi, I’m @Commentyourcode, a graphic designer, marketing professional, and IT student.
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in UX and UI design, and my goal is to improve the quality of the visual experience in websites, apps, programs, and even games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development at college and through multiple other sources to aid me, such as W3Schools and CodePen.
- 🖌 As a graphic designer, I am specialized in logo creation, and in publicity, my strongest attribute is branding for small and medium businesses.
